Here is my work for virtual intern at @codsoft
This repository contains my submitted tasks for the **CodSoft Virtual Internship** in **C++ Programming** (Juneâ€“July 2025).

# Intern Details

 **Name:** Mohammed Sameer   
 **Duration:** 25th June 2025 to 25th July 2025  
 **Domain:** C++ Programming  
 
## âœ… Task 1: Number Guessing Game  

A fun console-based game where the program randomly generates a number between 1 to 100. The user guesses the number until they get it right, with hints whether their guess is too high or too low.

## âœ… Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A console-based **2-player Tic-Tac-Toe game** developed in C++. Features include:

- 3x3 Game Board Display
- Input from both players alternately (Player X and Player O)
- Win and Draw condition checks
- Play-again option at the end

This task helped me explore arrays, functions, loops, and game logic implementation in C++.

## âœ… Task 4: To-Do List Manager

A simple console-based **To-Do List application** in C++ that allows users to manage daily tasks effectively. Key features include:

- Add tasks
- Show task 
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete tasks
- exit

This project improved my understanding of structures, arrays/vectors, functions, and user interaction in a CLI environment.
